For a complete description of how these data were collected, please see the corresponding manuscript. In brief, we were interested in whether, how, and why parasite burdens had changed for marine fishes over the past century. To address this question, we selected eight fish species that are common in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. We then sourced fluid-preserved natural history specimens of these species from the University of Washington Fish Collection at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, as well as other museums. Specimens had been collected between 1880 and 2019. We subjected these specimens to parasitological examination, counting and identifying all of their metazoan parasites. We also gathered data on potential environmental drivers of long-term change in parasite burden, including sea surface temperature, pollutant concentrations, and fish density. All data - including the parasitological data that we collected ourselves and the environmental data that were gathered from other sources - are presented here.


## Description of the data

final_dataset.csv - This dataset includes all the data we collected, including parasite counts, host body size, collection information for each host, natural history information for each parasite species, and data on sea surface temperature, pollutant concentrations, and fish density.

final_dataset_metadata.csv - This dataset includes metadata for interpreting final_dataset.csv.

parasite_species_codes.csv - This dataset includes a key for translating the long parasite codes presented in final_dataset.csv into short parasite codes presented in the manuscript itself.
