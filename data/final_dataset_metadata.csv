variable,definition
fish.id,"unique identification number for each host specimen; number includes the museum (e.g., UW), catalogue number used by the museum, and unique identifier for each individual fish within that catalogue number"
year,year in which host specimen was collected
site,locality where host specimen was collected as latitude longitude
lat,latitude of site in decimal degrees
long,longitude of site in decimal degrees
fish.spc,"species of the fish host (sole = Parophrys vetulus, rockfish = Sebastes caurinus, hake = Merluccius productus, pollock = Gadus chalcogrammus, perch = Embiotoca lateralis, smelt = Hypomesus pretiosus, ratfish = Hydrolagus colliei, herring = Clupea pallasii)"
length_mm,total length of fish in mm
length,"total length of fish in mm, standardized by centering on zero and scaling to have standard deviation = 1"
para.spc,"long code for parasite species (to translate these into the short codes shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary Information Table S3, see parasite_species_codes.csv) "
par.type,"broad taxonomic grouping of para.spc (i.e., Subclass Copepoda, Subclass Hirudinea, Class Monogenea, Class Trematoda, Class Cestoda, Phylum Nematoda, Phylum Acanthocephala; see also Supplementary Information Table S3)"
lifecycle,"transmission strategy of the parasite; designates whether para.spc has a direct life cycle (i.e., only one obligately required host species) or a complex life cycle (i.e., more than one obligately required host species; see also Supplementary Information Table S3)"
nhosts,"the number of obligately required host species in the parasite species' life cycle (= 1 for directly transmitted parasites, >1 for complex life cycle parasites)"
count,number of parasite individuals of para.spc found in host individual fish.id
sfish_density,standardized density of the fish host fish.spc; each fish.spc was standardized separately by centering on zero and scaling to have standard deviation = 1
temp_na_rm,temperature in degrees Celsius in the year of collection of host individual fish.id
ord1raw,raw values of ordination score for each fish.id from principal component axis 1
ord2raw,raw values of ordination score for each fish.id from principal component axis 2
ord1,"values of ordination score for each fish.id from principal component axis 1 after we removed outliers, interpolated for missing values, and ran LOESS smoothing"
ord2,"values of ordination score for each fish.id from principal component axis 2 after we removed outliers, interpolated for missing values, and ran LOESS smoothing"
